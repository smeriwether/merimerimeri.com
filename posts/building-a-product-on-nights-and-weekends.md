Like most software developers I've spent countless hours, outside of work, on side projects. Also like most software developers, I have nothing to show for it. I've mostly blamed myself - "I don't have enough discipline" is a common phrase echoing in my head. That very well may be true but that certainly isn't the entire story. I've spent the past few years getting out of my apartment: making friends, traveling, moving, falling in love, etc.. My life, interests, and motivations have changed. I'm proud of where I'm at and what I've accomplished. But I still haven't launched a side project. Maybe that'll change one day but for now, I'm trying not to be too hard on myself.  
  
This post was published using my new side project. Will it ever launch? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
