Tomorrow (11/10/20) is Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄòOne More Thing‚Äô event üë®‚Äçüíª. [Rumors have it](https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/06/apple-november-event-apple-silicon/) 
that we‚Äôll see the first ARM-powered Macs. The transition to ARM has 
a [ton of upside](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/) but the 
plan for a successful ecosystem transition [is murky](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556481/apple-new-arm-mac-expectations-preview-one-more-thing-event). 
I‚Äôm excited to see what gets announced tomorrow. Of all the things I‚Äôm 
excited about, there are 2 things that standout: graphics performance and 
the future of software development on the Mac.

## Graphics performance

Current-generation Macs are powered by a combination of Intel-built CPUs 
and discrete graphics cards. I suspect the transition to ARM will mean Apple 
will no longer be able to use discrete graphics cards. Meaning, Apple‚Äôs new 
chips will have Apple-built CPUs and GPUs. Based on the latest benchmarks of 
Apple‚Äôs A14 chip in the newest iPhones and iPads, I fully expect Apple Silicon 
to exceed the performance of Intel CPUs. I‚Äôm not as confident about GPU performance.

**Prediction**: Apple has decided now is the time to start the transition to ARM 
because it‚Äôs new chips will blow past current generation Macs in both CPU and GPU performance.

## The future of software development on the Mac

Basically every software developer I know, including myself, writes code on a Mac. They‚Äôre 
beautiful computers and MacOS is a stellar operating system. Over the past decade, 
software developers have created a vast ecosystem of tools for the Mac. And more, most 
production systems use the same x86-64 architecture currently found on the Mac. Will 
developers ensure their ecosystem of tools run smoothly on the new ARM architecture? And 
will we start to see more ARM-based production systems?

**Thoughts**: I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll hear much on this tomorrow. Software developers are a curious 
bunch, so I suspect most tools will be updated to support ARM-based Macs. As for production 
systems, I don‚Äôt see a switch to ARM happening anytime soon. That leaves developers in a 
precarious position. My money is on there being a lot of talk, without much action, and things 
will end up mostly fine.
