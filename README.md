# merimerimeri.com

[merimerimeri.com](https://merimerimeri.com) is my personal website. It's a simple static site that's served 
via my Mac Mini home server.

## Making changes in development

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site. Start the server by running
`hugo server -D`, changes are automatically picked up.

## Building for production

This site uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) which requires an extra environment variable when building.
You can build for production using `NODE_ENV=production hugo --gc --minify`.
