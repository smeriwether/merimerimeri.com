The [January issue of Wallpaper](https://www.wallpaper.com/design/january-2022-issue-read-more) 
gets a inside look at the design team at Apple:

> This is the first joint interview Hankey and Dye have given, and the first 
> time Apple has opened the doors to its fabled design studio – a cradle of 
> creativity and innovation, and the hub from which it shapes the world’s 
> evolving relationship with technology. The studio is also one of the most 
> faithfully guarded places of our time, as Apple has historically preferred 
> to release impeccably formed products without revealing its inner workings. 
> So I am honoured that the Design Team have made an exception for Wallpaper

They've sold out of the print version but the digital version was an instant buy.
