There’s no question in my mind that growing up, right now, is going to lead 
more kids to focus their careers on science and medicine. The worst thing 
that happened in early 2020 was a sort of worldwide collective denial. A sort 
of “OK, fine, there’s a bad virus going around Asia, we've heard this story 
before — it’s not going to be a major issue here” mindset. I certainly thought 
like that. It’s human nature. The fact that we hadn't had a major worldwide 
pandemic in a century led us to believe — not so much through reason, but more 
through gut feeling — that we couldn't have one. Not like this.

Today’s youth will never grow up feeling like that. For them, the next pandemic will 
always loom on the horizon.
