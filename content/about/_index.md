# A little about me

I live in Rochester, NY and I work as a web developer at Stride Consulting. I write about technology and other things at merimerimeri.com. I host a podcast with my best friend, and I'm usually working on one of the projects listed below. Oh, and I'm dating Malayna Hocker. I ❤️ the web.
