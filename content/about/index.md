### A little about me

I live in Rochester, NY and I work as a web developer at [Stride Consulting](https://stridenyc.com). I
host a [podcast](https://themodern.fm) with my best friend, and I'm usually working on one of the 
projects listed below. Oh, and I'm dating [Malayna Hocker](https://malaynahocker.com). I ❤️ the web.


### What I'm working on

* [A History of my income](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11i3DKxcEWxukerfZi9Z_RJy1d6COgQYNm4KDW3_1A98/edit?usp=sharing) - A 
few years ago I started publishing my income online for anyone to see. We don't really talk about money 
and that leads to unequity. I wanted to do my small part to bend the arc towards fairness.

* [Locally Curated](https://locallycurated.com) - An online bookshelf for companies I'm 
building Locally Curated with a friend. We think that a company's bookshelf tells a story, 
about who they are and what they believe. We want to help companies tell that story.

* [The Modern Podcast Network](https://themodern.fm) - A podcast network I started with 
a friend. We only have a few podcasts, but we're growing!
