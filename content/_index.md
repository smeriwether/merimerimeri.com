Hi folks! I'm Stephen Meriwether and this is my website. I live in Rochester, NY with my girlfriend [Malayna Hocker](https://malaynahocker.com).
I work as a Software Engineer and Engineering Manager at [Stride Consulting](https://stridenyc.com). All of my income comes from my job at Stride and
a few years ago I decided to make my [income public](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11i3DKxcEWxukerfZi9Z_RJy1d6COgQYNm4KDW3_1A98/edit?usp=sharing). 
I talk on the [Modern Podcast Network](https://themodern.fm) with my best friend. 

I've been obsessed with technology for as long as I can remember. I use this website to share my thoughts on
what's happening in the tech world and I sometimes share life milestones. Everything I'm written is in my 
[writing archive](/essays/), here are a few of my favorites:

* [Everyday Mac Apps](/essays/mac-apps/)
* [On leaving NYC](/essays/leaving-nyc/)
* [Chia fundamentals and plotting Chia in parallel](/essays/chia-fundamentals/)
