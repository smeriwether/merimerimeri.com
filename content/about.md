Hello. My name is Stephen Meriwether. I live in Rochester, NY with my girlfriend [Malayna Hocker](https://malaynahocker.com).

I work as a Software Engineer and Engineering Manager at [Stride Consulting](https://stridenyc.com), based in New York City. 
I co-founded the [Modern Podcast Network](https://themodern.fm) with my best friend.

I've followed technology for as long as I can remember. I use this website to share the most interesting things I've found
across the internet, things I've learned that are worth sharing, and things in my life that I feel are important.
