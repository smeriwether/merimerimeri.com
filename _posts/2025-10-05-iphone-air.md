Stephen Hackett, writing at 512Pixels for an article titled [iPhone Heir to the Throne](https://512pixels.net/2025/10/iphone-air-review/), said of the iPhone Air:

> Its design is breathtaking. I’ve been using it as my primary phone for almost two weeks, and every time I pick it up, I get a little jolt of disbelief.

I knew I was going to buy a new iPhone this year, but I didn’t pre-order. I *knew* I’d end up with an iPhone 17 Pro — I’m a *Pro* user — but I wanted to read the iPhone Air reviews first. I was intrigued, even if I thought it couldn’t be for me. [Ben Thompson on Dithering](https://dithering.passport.online/member/episode/ben-buys-an-i-phone) pushed me over the edge:

> John I'm in love. I'm in love with an Apple product in a way I have not felt in love with an Apple product in years. It feels amazing. Every time I pull it out of my pocket, I'll just be using it standing in line at the coffee shop and just have a whimsy of delight.

Ben nails it. Holding the iPhone Air really does evoke that “jolt of disbelief,” and the same “whimsy of delight” has become a daily occurrence. Apple did it — in a year when my fandom felt like it was fading, they pulled me back in.

Oh, and Liquid Glass? It feels like it was made for the iPhone Air. It’s just great.
