This week my alma mater, the University of Houston, is ranked in the Top 25 in both football and basketball. The basketball team is currently ranked #2 in the nation, and the football team, after [beating Arizona State last weekend](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401756929), is now ranked #22.

Only seven schools hold Top 25 rankings in both sports. By [my math](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G6KFyHkGPr4f6QPjYsaMCJzcpGn2JFy-Pv6QKYjV6h8/edit?usp=sharing), that makes UH the 3rd best sports college in the country. My math might be biased, but this is cool no matter how you spin it. I remember the dark ages for both programs â€” a lot of credit goes to the people who turned things around.

Go Coogs!
