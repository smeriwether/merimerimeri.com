title: "📚 Hell Yeah or No Book Review"
---

I recently read [Hell Yeah or No by Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/n). Derek labels himself as someone who's been a "musician, producer, 
circus performer, entrepreneur, TED speaker, and book publisher." He frequently writes on his [blog](https://sive.rs/blog) and 
has a [podcast](https://sive.rs/podcast). "Hell Yeah or No" is a collection of his writings, made into chapters, and organized into 
sections. The book is about life, about what's worth doing, saying no and saying yes, fixing faulty thinking, and making things happen. 
Everything in this book is freely available online, you can read the entire book on his website. 

I've consumed Derek's work for years. I've read most of his blog, listened to all of his podcasts, and read his first book. So, it was 
only natural that I'd read his latest book. Although there's nothing "new" in this book, Derek's writings are worth re-reading, regularly. 
His writings are, as he puts it, a ["counterpoint meant to complement the popular point"](https://sive.rs/counter). I'm happy I took the 
time to re-read Derek's work and I'll continue to read everything that Derek publishes. 

Since each chapter stands on its own, I want to highlight a few of my favorite chapters below.

* [Character predicts your future](https://sive.rs/character)

> "How you do anything is how you do everything. It all matters."

* [If you’re not feeling “hell yeah!” then say no](https://sive.rs/hyn)

> "Say no to almost everything. ... Saying no makes your yes more powerful."

* [Don't be a donkey](https://sive.rs/donkey)

> "You can do everything you want to do. You just need foresight and patience."

* [Imagining lots of tedious steps? Or one fun step?](https://sive.rs/steps)

> "If we hate doing something, we think of it as hard. We picture it having many annoying steps. If we love doing something, it seems simple."

* [I assume I'm below average](https://sive.rs/below-average)

> "To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning."

* [Goals shape the present, not the future.](https://sive.rs/goals)

> "The purpose of goals is not to improve the future. ... Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment."

* [Whatever scares you, go do it](https://sive.rs/scares)

> "Legendary psychologist Abraham Maslow said it well: “Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) 
and risk (for the sake of progress and growth). Make the growth choice a dozen times a day.”"
