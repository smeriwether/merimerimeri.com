## A few words

### 1Password

My password manager. It's the best designed password manager I've used and does everything I need it to.

Link: [1Password](https://1password.com)

### Audio Hijack

An audio recording app I've only recently started using. I record all of my podcast epsidoes in Audio Hijack.

Link: [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/)

### Authy

My 2FA manager. I use this instead of stroing codes in 1Password because it's faster to grab a code when I need it. Their Mac app is okay.

Link: [Authy](https://authy.com)

### Bartender 4

A tool to hide menu bar icons. Basically a must-have since [the notch](https://sixcolors.com/member/2021/10/the-back-page-notch-your-business/).

Link: [Bartender 4](https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender4/)

### Better Blocker

An ad blocker and privacy tool by the Small Technology Foundation. I use it across iOS and MacOs. As they says on their website, it just works.

Link: [Better Blocker](https://better.fyi)

### Calendar

I use the built-in Calendar app for iOS and MacOS. It works for me and it's free.

### Contrast

A small menu-bar utility to test the contrast between two colors. This helps me build accessible websites.

Link: [Contrast](https://usecontrast.com)

### CotEditor

A few, open-source text editor that's really fast. It checked all three boxes.

Link: [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com)

### Craft

Where I store my digital notes. It's fast, [Mac-assed](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps), and supports backlinks.

Link: [Craft](https://www.craft.do)

### Daisy Disk

A tool to manage disk space. It's my favorite tool to see and free disk space on my computers.

Link: [Daisy Disk](https://daisydiskapp.com)

### Forecast

An mp3 chapter encoder built by Marco Arment. I sometimes use this to when editting podcasts.

Link: [Forecast](https://overcast.fm/forecast)

### GarageBand

What I use to edit podcasts. I don't have complex needs and it gets the job done well.

### Google Chrome

Not my primary browser but I have all the big ones installed to test webpages.

Link: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

### Google Drive for Desktop

My online backup tool. It works well and is cheap, I pay $3/month for 200 GBs.

Link: [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)

### IntelliJ IDEA

A must-have editor for Java development. For everything else I use Vim.

Link: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

### KeepingYouAwake

A tool to prevent the Mac from sleeping. it's free and open-source. This is the best replacement for the O.G. app Caffine.

Link: [KeepingYouAwake](https://keepingyouawake.app)

### Mail

I use the built-in Mail app. I [used to use Hey but now I don't](https://merimerimeri.com/last-post-to-hey-world/).

### Maps

I also use the built-in Maps app. I made the switch from Google Maps a few years ago in an attemp to de-google my life. I've sinced walked that back in some ways but not maps.

### Meeter

A must-have menu bar utility for remote work. It finds Zoom or Google Meet links from your calendar and organizes them into a dropdown menu. Now it takes two clicks to join a meeting.

Link: [Meeter](https://trymeeter.com)

### Messages

The primary way I communicate with people is through iMessage.

### Mozilla Firefox

Also not my primary browser, I use it the same way I use Google Chrome.

Link: [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

### News+

I subscribe to Apple One Premium and occasionally check Apple News+.

### Notability

I try to include a drawing with each post, those are drawn in Notability on my iPad and sync'd to all of my devices.

Link: [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com)

### Notes

Only the randomest of notes go in here, everything else lives in Craft.

### Overcast

My podcast player of choice, now available on the Mac via Apple Silicon.

Link: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)

### Photos

I don't take many photos so don't need anything more than what's built-in.

### Pixelmator Pro

My photo editor tool of choice. I don't use it often but it gets the job done when I do. It's not cheap but it's also not a subscription.

Link: [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)

### Postgres.app

The best way to run a Postgres database on a Mac.

Link: [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com)

### Postico

The best way to query a Postgres database on a Mac.

Link: [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

### Rectangle

A free, open-source window manager. I mainly use it to put two windows side-by-side, not much else.

Link: [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)

### Reeder 5

My RSS reader and Read-it-later app. I love RSS.

Link: [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com)

### Safari

My primary browser. It's fast and is the most power-efficient browser for Macs.

### Shortcuts

I've only recently started using Shortcuts. I've built more automations in a couple of days with Shortcuts than I ever did with Automator.

### Slack

I use Slack for work but not much else.

Link: [Slack](https://slack.com)

### Spotify

The best way to stream music, though I'm a little biased.

Link: [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)

### Things 3

My task manager. The most [Mac-assed Mac app](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps) out there.

Link: [Things 3](https://postgresapp.com)

### Tweetbot 6

A Twitter client I use on iOS and now also use on the Mac. It syncs my timeline progress and doesn't reorder my feed randomly.

Link: [Tweetbot 6](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)

### iTerm 2

My favorite terminal client. It's better than what's built-in by a wide margin.

Link: [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com)
