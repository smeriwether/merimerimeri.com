## A few words

### 1Blocker

The best ad blocker I've found. I used to use [Better](https://better.fyi), but it was
discontinued. 1Blocker is the next best option

Link: [1Blocker](https://1blocker.com)

### 1Password

My password manager. It's the best designed password manager I've used and does everything I need it to.

Link: [1Password](https://1password.com)

### AirBuddy

A small tool to improve the AirPods experience on a Mac. 

Link: [AirBuddy](https://v2.airbuddy.app)

### Audio Hijack

An audio recording app I've only recently started using. I record all of my podcast epsidoes in Audio Hijack.

Link: [Audio Hijack](https://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/)

### Authy

My 2FA manager. I use this instead of stroing codes in 1Password because it's faster to grab a code when I need it. Their Mac app is okay.

Link: [Authy](https://authy.com)

### Bartender 4

A tool to hide menu bar icons. Basically a must-have since [the notch](https://sixcolors.com/member/2021/10/the-back-page-notch-your-business/).

Link: [Bartender 4](https://www.macbartender.com/Bartender4/)

### CotEditor

A few, open-source text editor that's really fast. It checked all three boxes.

Link: [CotEditor](https://coteditor.com)

### Craft

Where I store my digital notes. It's fast, [Mac-assed](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps), and supports backlinks.

Link: [Craft](https://www.craft.do)

### Daisy Disk

A tool to manage disk space. It's my favorite tool to see and free disk space on my computers.

Link: [Daisy Disk](https://daisydiskapp.com)

### Fantastical 

My calendar app of choice. I used to use the built-in Calendar app but managing work calendars
became a pain, it's easy with Fantastical. I'm now a happy Flexibits Premium subscriber.

Link: [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)

### Forecast

An mp3 chapter encoder built by Marco Arment. I sometimes use this to when editting podcasts.

Link: [Forecast](https://overcast.fm/forecast)

### GarageBand

What I use to edit podcasts. I don't have complex needs and it gets the job done well.

### Google Drive for Desktop

My online backup tool. It works well and is cheap, I pay $3/month for 200 GBs.

Link: [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)

### Hand Mirror

A menu-bar app to quickly get a view of your camera, it only takes one click.

Link: [Hand Mirror](https://handmirror.app)

### iTerm 2

My favorite terminal client. It's better than what's built-in by a wide margin.

Link: [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com)

### KeepingYouAwake

A tool to prevent the Mac from sleeping. it's free and open-source. This is the best replacement for the O.G. app Caffine.

Link: [KeepingYouAwake](https://keepingyouawake.app)

### Mimestream

The best native Gmail experience on a Mac. The app is in beta right now, though works wonderfully, and I'll happily pay for it
once it leaves beta.

Link: [Mimestream](https://mimestream.com)

### Mullvad VPN

I don't use a VPN often but when I do I use Mullvad. What I want from a VPN is privacy and 
security, Mullvad does both better than anybody else.

Link: [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en/)

### Overcast

My podcast player of choice, now available on the Mac via Apple Silicon.

Link: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)

### Pixelmator Pro

My photo editor tool of choice. I don't use it often but it gets the job done when I do. It's not cheap but it's also not a subscription.

Link: [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)

### Postico

The best way to query a Postgres database on a Mac.

Link: [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

### Rectangle

A free, open-source window manager. I mainly use it to put two windows side-by-side, not much else.

Link: [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)

### Reeder 5

My RSS reader and Read-it-later app. I love RSS.

Link: [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com)

### Remote Desktop

I have a few different home servers and Remote Desktop is the best "remote" management tool I've found. I say "remote
because I've only gotten it to work at home, so "remote" as in not plugged into directly not as in a remote location.

Link: [Remote Desktop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-remote-desktop/id409907375?mt=12)

### Screens 4

When I'm away from home I used Screens 4 to remotely management my home servers (see above for what I use at home). It's
not a great tool but I've used it reliabily without complaints.

Link: [Screens 4](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=screens+4&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)

### Spotify

The best way to stream music, though I'm a little biased.

Link: [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)

### Things 3

My task manager. The most [Mac-assed Mac app](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/03/20/mac-assed-mac-apps) out there.

Link: [Things 3](https://postgresapp.com)

### Tweetbot 6

A Twitter client I use on iOS and now also use on the Mac. It syncs my timeline progress and doesn't reorder my feed randomly.
