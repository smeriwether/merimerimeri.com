    </p>
    <p>
      I live in Rochester, New York with my partner <a href="https://www.malaynahocker.com" class="link" target="_blank">Malayna Hocker</a>. I work as a Software Engineer
      and Engineering Manager at <a href="https://stridenyc.com" class="link" target="_blank">Stride Consulting</a>. All of my income comes from my job at Stride and a
      few years ago I decided to make my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WduTHPTiD9JnSZd2HgRURSXuft9VeuAl/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109736149676047942865&rtpof=true&sd=true" class="link" target="_blank">income public</a>.
      I occasionally have fun talking on the <a href="https://themodern.fm" class="link" target="_blank">Modern Podcast Network</a> with my friend.

    </p>
    <p>
      I've been interested with technology for as long as I can remember and, recently, I've started to dabble with photography.
      I use this website to share my thoughts on whatâ€™s happening in tech, to share the photos I've taken, and sometimes to share life milestones.
